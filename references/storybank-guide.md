# Storybank Guide

A searchable index of career experiences, organized for quick retrieval during interviews.

---

## Storybank Format

Create a table with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier (S001, S002, etc.) |
| **Title** | Memorable, specific name (not "led project") |
| **Primary Skill** | Main competency demonstrated |
| **Secondary Skill** | Additional competency (optional) |
| **Impact** | Quantified outcome or explanation if not quantifiable |
| **Domain** | Technical / Product / Business / People |
| **Risk/Stakes** | What could have gone wrong? Why did it matter? |
| **Earned Secret** | The counterintuitive insight only you learned from this experience (see `references/differentiation.md` for extraction protocol) |
| **Strength** | How compelling/differentiated (1-5) |
| **Last Used** | Date of most recent use in interview |
| **Notes** | Performance notes, feedback received |

### Full Story Text

The storybank table above is a quick-reference index. The **full STAR text** of each story lives in the Story Details section of `coaching_state.md` — including Situation, Task, Action, Result, Earned Secret detail, deploy use-case, and version history. When adding or improving stories, always write the full text to Story Details, not just the index row. This ensures the coach can reference, improve, and coach on the full story in future sessions without asking the candidate to retell it from scratch.

### Skill Tags (standardized)

Use consistent tags for searchability:
- Leadership
- Collaboration
- Problem-solving
- Data-driven decision making
- Communication
- Technical depth
- Strategic thinking
- Ambiguity navigation
- Conflict resolution
- Customer focus
- Innovation
- Execution/delivery
- Mentorship
- Influence without authority

## Building Your Initial Storybank

### Step 1: Guided Exploration

Rather than just listing accomplishments, use reflective prompts to surface stories that matter. Start with:

**Peak experiences:**
- "Think about a time you were at your best at work. What were you doing? What made it different from a typical day?"
- "When have you felt most energized by your work? What was happening?"

**Challenge and growth:**
- "What's the hardest professional situation you've navigated? What made it hard specifically?"
- "Tell me about a time you changed your mind about something important. What shifted?"

**Impact and influence:**
- "When have you made something happen that wouldn't have happened without you?"
- "Tell me about a time you convinced someone who disagreed with you. How did you approach it?"

**Failure and learning:**
- "What's a decision you'd make differently with hindsight? What did you learn?"
- "When have things not gone according to plan? What did you do?"

The reflective prompts tend to surface richer, more authentic stories than a pure brainstorm list.

### Step 2: STAR Format Each

For each story, capture:
- **Situation**: Context and constraints (2-3 sentences)
- **Task**: Your specific responsibility (1-2 sentences)
- **Action**: What YOU did (3-5 sentences, specific)
- **Result**: Outcome with metrics if possible (2-3 sentences)

### Step 3: Index and Tag

Create the table entry for each story. Be honest about strength scores:
- **5**: Unique, quantified, memorable—would impress any interviewer
- **4**: Strong with good evidence, minor gaps
- **3**: Solid but generic—others could tell similar stories
- **2**: Thin evidence or weak outcome
- **1**: Barely usable—retire candidate

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

After indexing, identify:
- **Competency gaps**: Which key skills lack strong (4+) stories?
- **Domain gaps**: Missing technical? Business? People stories?
- **Recency gaps**: Are all stories from one job? Too old?
- **Risk gaps**: Do any stories show real stakes/failure?

## Maintaining Your Storybank

### After Each Interview

Update the storybank:
1. Mark which stories were used (Last Used date)
2. Add performance notes (did it land? feedback?)
3. Adjust strength scores based on actual performance
4. Note any new stories that emerged in conversation

---

## Story Selection Strategy

When matching stories to questions:

### 1. Competency Match
Which stories demonstrate the competency being tested?

### 2. Company Fit
Which stories align with this company's values and priorities?

### 3. Freshness
Have you used this story recently with this company? Avoid repeats.

### 4. Strength
Choose 4+ stories when possible. Save 3s for backup.

### 5. Variety
Across an interview loop, show range: different projects, skills, outcomes.

---

## Story Retirement Criteria

Retire a story when:
- **Strength < 3** for more than 2 interviews
- **Overused**: Used 5+ times, interviewers might have heard it
- **Outdated**: More than 5-7 years old with nothing unique
- **Redundant**: Another story covers the same competency better
- **Didn't land**: Consistently gets weak follow-ups or confused looks

Don't delete retired stories—archive them. They might be useful for different roles or after refreshing with new details.

## Story Enhancement

### Making a 3 into a 4

Invite the person to deepen the story themselves first:
- "What's missing from this story that you remember but haven't included?"
- "If a friend asked you 'why does this story matter to you?' — what would you say?"
- "What was at stake if this had gone wrong?"

Then suggest specific enhancements:
- Can you add a specific metric?
- Can you name the stakes more clearly?
- Can you add a moment of conflict or difficult decision?
- Can you include what you'd do differently?

### Making a 4 into a 5

Guide self-discovery of what makes the story unique:
- "What do you know now because of this experience that you couldn't have known otherwise?"
- "If someone else told a similar story, what would be different about yours?"
- "What would surprise someone who wasn't there?"

Then layer in:
- What's the earned secret from this experience?
- Can you add third-party validation (quote, award, recognition)?
- Can you show alternatives considered and why you chose this path?
- What makes this story uniquely yours—something competitors can't claim?

## Example Storybank Entry

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **ID** | S007 |
| **Title** | "Killed the feature everyone wanted" |
| **Primary Skill** | Data-driven decision making |
| **Secondary Skill** | Influence without authority |
| **Impact** | Saved 3 engineering sprints; redirected effort to feature that drove 25% activation increase |
| **Domain** | Product |
| **Risk/Stakes** | Entire sales team wanted this feature; CEO had promised it to key customer |
| **Earned Secret** | The fastest way to kill a feature is to let it succeed at small scale — it becomes politically unkillable before you have real data |
| **Strength** | 5 |
| **Last Used** | 2024-01-15 (Stripe PM interview) |
| **Notes** | Landed very well. Interviewer asked 3 follow-ups, all positive. Use for prioritization Qs. |

## Quick Reference: Storybank Health Check

**Healthy storybank:**
- 8-12 indexed stories
- At least 5 rated strength 4+
- All key competencies covered
- Mix of domains (not all one type)
- At least 2 stories with quantified outcomes
- At least 1 failure/learning story
- No story used more than 3x in current job search

**Warning signs:**
- Fewer than 6 stories
- Most stories rated 3 or below
- Major competency gaps
- All stories from one job/era
- No failure stories
- Relying on 2-3 favorites repeatedly
- No earned secrets extracted (stories are specific but not distinctive)

## Rapid-Retrieval Drill

A well-organized storybank is useless if the candidate can't access it under pressure. The moment of truth is mid-interview: you hear a question you didn't expect and need to find the right story in 3 seconds. This drill trains that reflex.

### Setup

Requires: A storybank with 8+ indexed stories.

### Protocol

1. Coach throws 10 interview questions in rapid succession (one at a time).
2. For each question, candidate has **10 seconds** to respond with:
   - Story ID (e.g., "S007")
   - Opening line (the first sentence they'd say in the interview)
3. No full answers — this is about retrieval speed, not delivery quality.
4. Mix question types: behavioral, situational, curveball, gap-testing.
5. Include 1-2 questions where no story is a great fit (tests gap-handling instinct).

### Scoring Per Round

| Metric | Strong | Adequate | Needs Work |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Retrieval speed** | Instant (<3s) | Hesitant (3-7s) | Stuck (>7s or blank) |
| **Match quality** | Strong fit for the question | Partial fit — could work with framing | Wrong story — doesn't address the question |
| **Opening line** | Hooks attention, front-loads the headline | Functional but generic start | Fumbled, no clear entry point |

### Debrief

After 10 rounds:
- Which questions caused the most hesitation? (signals retrieval gaps)
- Did the candidate reach for the wrong story anywhere? (signals indexing issues)
- Were there questions where no story fit? (signals storybank gaps — add to gap analysis)
- What opening lines were strongest? (build on these patterns)

### Progression

- **Round 1**: Standard behavioral questions (warmup)
- **Round 2**: Role-specific questions (harder matching)
- **Round 3**: Curveball and gap-testing questions (stress test)
- **Round 4**: Time-pressured — 5 seconds instead of 10

Run this drill weekly until retrieval feels automatic. The storybank isn't real until you can use it under pressure.
