# Storybank Guide

Your storybank is a searchable index of career experiences, organized for quick retrieval during interviews. It turns scattered memories into strategic assets.

## Why a Storybank?

Without one:
- You grab the first story that comes to mind (often not the best fit)
- You overuse favorites and neglect strong alternatives
- You can't see coverage gaps until an interview exposes them
- You forget details that made stories compelling

With one:
- Match the right story to each question instantly
- Spot gaps before interviews
- Retire weak stories before they hurt you
- Track which stories land and which fall flat

## Storybank Format

Create a table with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier (S001, S002, etc.) |
| **Title** | Memorable, specific name (not "led project") |
| **Primary Skill** | Main competency demonstrated |
| **Secondary Skill** | Additional competency (optional) |
| **Impact** | Quantified outcome or explanation if not quantifiable |
| **Domain** | Technical / Product / Business / People |
| **Risk/Stakes** | What could have gone wrong? Why did it matter? |
| **Strength** | How compelling/differentiated (1-5) |
| **Last Used** | Date of most recent use in interview |
| **Notes** | Performance notes, feedback received |

### Skill Tags (standardized)

Use consistent tags for searchability:
- Leadership
- Collaboration
- Problem-solving
- Data-driven decision making
- Communication
- Technical depth
- Strategic thinking
- Ambiguity navigation
- Conflict resolution
- Customer focus
- Innovation
- Execution/delivery
- Mentorship
- Influence without authority

## Building Your Initial Storybank

### Step 1: Brain Dump

List every significant project, challenge, or accomplishment from the last 5-7 years. Don't filter yet. Include:
- Major projects you led or contributed to
- Problems you solved
- Conflicts you navigated
- Failures you learned from
- Times you influenced without authority
- Moments you're proud of
- Feedback you received (positive or constructive)

### Step 2: STAR Format Each

For each story, capture:
- **Situation**: Context and constraints (2-3 sentences)
- **Task**: Your specific responsibility (1-2 sentences)
- **Action**: What YOU did (3-5 sentences, specific)
- **Result**: Outcome with metrics if possible (2-3 sentences)

### Step 3: Index and Tag

Create the table entry for each story. Be honest about strength scores:
- **5**: Unique, quantified, memorable—would impress any interviewer
- **4**: Strong with good evidence, minor gaps
- **3**: Solid but generic—others could tell similar stories
- **2**: Thin evidence or weak outcome
- **1**: Barely usable—retire candidate

### Step 4: Gap Analysis

After indexing, identify:
- **Competency gaps**: Which key skills lack strong (4+) stories?
- **Domain gaps**: Missing technical? Business? People stories?
- **Recency gaps**: Are all stories from one job? Too old?
- **Risk gaps**: Do any stories show real stakes/failure?

## Maintaining Your Storybank

### After Each Interview

Update the storybank:
1. Mark which stories were used (Last Used date)
2. Add performance notes (did it land? feedback?)
3. Adjust strength scores based on actual performance
4. Note any new stories that emerged in conversation

### Weekly Review

Spend 15 minutes:
- Flag overused stories (used 3+ times recently)
- Identify underused stories that deserve airtime
- Check if any stories should be retired
- Add new experiences from current work

### Monthly Audit

Spend 30 minutes:
- Review strength scores against actual interview performance
- Retire stories scoring <3 consistently
- Identify gaps that need new stories
- Refresh details on aging stories (check if metrics still accurate)

---

## Story Selection Strategy

When matching stories to questions:

### 1. Competency Match
Which stories demonstrate the competency being tested?

### 2. Company Fit
Which stories align with this company's values and priorities?

### 3. Freshness
Have you used this story recently with this company? Avoid repeats.

### 4. Strength
Choose 4+ stories when possible. Save 3s for backup.

### 5. Variety
Across an interview loop, show range: different projects, skills, outcomes.

---

## Story Retirement Criteria

Retire a story when:
- **Strength < 3** for more than 2 interviews
- **Overused**: Used 5+ times, interviewers might have heard it
- **Outdated**: More than 5-7 years old with nothing unique
- **Redundant**: Another story covers the same competency better
- **Didn't land**: Consistently gets weak follow-ups or confused looks

Don't delete retired stories—archive them. They might be useful for different roles or after refreshing with new details.

## Story Enhancement

### Making a 3 into a 4

Ask:
- Can I add a specific metric?
- Can I name the stakes more clearly?
- Can I add a moment of conflict or difficult decision?
- Can I include what I'd do differently?

### Making a 4 into a 5

Ask:
- What's the earned secret from this experience?
- Can I add third-party validation (quote, award, recognition)?
- Can I show alternatives considered and why I chose this path?
- What makes this story uniquely mine—something competitors can't claim?

| **Strength** | 5 |
| **Last Used** | 2024-01-15 (Stripe PM interview) |
