# help — Command Reference Workflow

### Logic

When the user types `help`, generate a context-aware command guide — not just a static list.

1. **Read `coaching_state.md`** to understand where the candidate is in their coaching journey.
2. **Show the full command guide** (see Output Schema below) with sub-commands and key features for each command.
3. **Highlight the 2-3 most relevant commands right now** based on coaching state:
   - If no coaching state exists: highlight `kickoff`
   - If storybank is empty: highlight `stories`
   - If storybank has 5+ stories but no narrative identity analysis: highlight `stories` (mention option 7)
   - If an interview is scheduled within 48 hours: highlight `hype` and `prep`
   - If transcripts exist but haven't been analyzed: highlight `analyze`
   - If 3+ scored sessions exist: highlight `progress`
   - If an offer was received: highlight `negotiate`
   - If drill progression shows the candidate hasn't completed Stage 1: highlight `practice ladder`
   - If the candidate mentions recruiter feedback or an outcome in conversation but hasn't used `feedback`: highlight `feedback`
4. **Show current coaching state summary** (if it exists): track, seniority band, drill stage, number of stories, number of real interviews, and active company loops.
5. **End with a prompt**: "What would you like to work on?"

## Command Guide

### Getting Started
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `kickoff` | Set up your profile, choose a track (Quick Prep or Full System), and get a prioritized action plan based on your timeline |

### Interview Prep
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `research [company]` | Lightweight company research + fit assessment before committing to full prep |
| `prep [company]` | Full prep brief — format guidance, culture read, interviewer intelligence (from LinkedIn URLs), predicted questions (weighted by real questions from past interviews when available), story mapping, and a day-of cheat sheet |
| `concerns` | Anticipate likely interviewer concerns about your profile + counter-evidence strategies |
| `questions` | Generate 5 tailored, non-generic questions to ask your interviewer |
| `hype` | Pre-interview boost — 60-second hype reel, 3x3 sheet (concerns + counters + questions), warmup routine, and mid-interview recovery playbook |

### Practice and Simulation
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `practice` | Drill menu with 8 gated stages + standalone retrieval. Sub-commands: `ladder` (constraint drills), `pushback` (handle skepticism), `pivot` (redirect), `gap` (no-example moments), `role` (specialist scrutiny), `panel` (multiple personas), `stress` (high-pressure), `technical` (system design communication). Standalone: `retrieval` (rapid-fire story matching). Includes interviewer's perspective on every round. |
| `mock [format]` | Full 4-6 question simulated interview with holistic arc feedback and interviewer's inner monologue. Formats: `behavioral screen`, `deep behavioral`, `panel`, `bar raiser`, `system design/case study`, `technical+behavioral mix` |

### Analysis and Scoring
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `analyze` | Paste a transcript for per-answer 5-dimension scoring, triage-based coaching (branches based on YOUR bottleneck), answer rewrites showing what a 4-5 version looks like, intelligence updates (tracks questions and patterns across interviews), and a specific recommended next step |
| `debrief` | Post-interview rapid capture — works same-day with or without a transcript. Captures questions, interviewer signals, stories used, recruiter feedback, and checks for question patterns from past interviews |

### Storybank
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `stories` | Full storybank management. Options: `view`, `add` (guided discovery, not just "tell me a story"), `improve` (structured upgrade with before/after), `find gaps` (prioritized by target roles), `retire`, `drill` (rapid-fire retrieval practice), `narrative identity` (extract your 2-3 core career themes and see how every story connects) |

### Progress and Tracking
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `progress` | Score trends, self-assessment calibration (are you an over-rater or under-rater?), storybank health, outcome tracking (correlates practice scores with real interview results), question-type performance analysis, accumulated patterns from real interviews, and coaching meta-check |

### Post-Interview
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `feedback` | Capture recruiter feedback, report outcomes (advanced/rejected/offer), correct assessments, or add context the system should remember. The system learns from your real interview experiences over time. |
| `thankyou` | Thank-you note and follow-up drafts tailored to the interview |
| `negotiate` | Post-offer negotiation coaching — market analysis, strategy, exact scripts, and fallback language |
| `reflect` | Post-search retrospective — journey arc, breakthroughs, transferable skills, archived coaching state |

### Meta
| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `help` | This command guide (context-aware recommendations based on where you are) |

## Where You Are Now
[Brief coaching state summary — track, seniority, drill stage, story count, active company loops — or "No coaching state found. Run `kickoff` to get started."]

## Recommended Next
Based on where you are:
1. **[command]** — [why this is the highest-leverage move right now]
2. **[command]** — [secondary recommendation]

---

## Tips
- Share a real resume during `kickoff` — it powers everything downstream (concerns, positioning, story seeds)
- Use `debrief` the same day as a real interview — capture signals while they're fresh
- When you hear back from a recruiter — good or bad — run `feedback` to capture it. The system learns from your real interview experiences over time.
- Run `progress` weekly — it tracks your self-assessment accuracy, not just scores
- After real interviews, log outcomes — the system correlates practice scores with real results
- Set your feedback directness level (1-5) during `kickoff` — the diagnosis stays the same, only the delivery changes
- Everything saves automatically to `coaching_state.md` — pick up where you left off, even weeks later
