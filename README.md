## What This Does

Instead of generic interview advice, this skill gives you:

* **Slash commands** for instant access to any feature (`/prep`, `/analyze`, `/practice`, `/hype`, and more)
* **LinkedIn integration** that enriches your profile and analyzes your interviewers
* **Company-specific prep** with predicted questions, competitive positioning, and strategic counters
* **Transcript analysis** that scores harshly across multiple dimensions (no sycophantic praise)
* **Practice drills**: constraint ladder, adversarial follow-ups, interruption handling, recovery tactics
* **Storybank management** to track, improve, and retire your interview stories
* **Differentiation coaching** to escape the "AI-polished middle" where everyone sounds the same

## How to Use

### First Time Setup

Type `/setup`. Upload your resume and LinkedIn profile URL. Tell Claude your target role. That's it.

**Why LinkedIn?** It provides richer context than a resume alone—career narrative, endorsements, recommendations, and how you present yourself publicly.

### Before an Interview

```
/prep Stripe
```

Then share the job description. Claude generates:

* What they optimize for (based on JD + values)
* Your unique positioning
* 7-10 predicted questions
* Concerns about your background + how to counter them
* Non-generic questions to ask them
* **Know Your Interviewer cards** (if you share interviewer LinkedIn profiles)

### After an Interview

```
/analyze
```

Paste your transcript (use [Granola](https://granola.ai), [Otter](https://otter.ai), or [Tactiq](https://tactiq.io) to capture interviews).

Claude analyzes from multiple perspectives:

* Hiring manager (would they advance you?)
* Skeptical specialist (where did you lack depth?)
* Values alignment (which principles did you miss?)
* Calibration (verbosity, hedging, jargon density)

You get a one-page "delta sheet" with exactly what to fix. **Expect harsh scores.** A 3/5 is average.

### Practice Mode

```
/practice
```

Options include:

* `/practice ladder` — Same story at 15s, 45s, 90s, 3min
* `/practice pushback` — Adversarial follow-ups to your stories
* `/practice role` — Deep pressure test for your function
* `/practice panel` — Mock panel with different interviewer types
* `/practice pivot` — Handle interruptions and topic shifts

### Pre-Interview Boost

```
/hype
```

Get a 60-second "hype reel" of your wins to read aloud, plus a 3x3 sheet (3 likely concerns + counters, 3 questions to ask).

### Manage Your Stories

```
/stories
```

View, add, improve, or retire stories in your storybank. Claude tracks which stories you've used, how they performed, and when to retire them.

## Two Tracks: Quick Prep vs Full System

**Quick Prep** (~30 min per interview)

* Company prep brief
* Basic transcript scoring
* Key improvements to focus on

**Full System** (~2-3 hours initially, then compounds)

* Storybank with gap analysis
* Multi-lens scoring from 4 perspectives
* Pattern tracking across interviews
* Weekly reviews with trend analysis
* Differentiation coaching

Choose your track during `/setup`. You can upgrade later.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Share your LinkedIn** — Richer context = better coaching
2. **Share interviewer profiles** — Get "Know Your Interviewer" cards with rapport builders and likely focus areas
3. **Use real transcripts** — Recording your interviews is the fastest way to improve
4. **Expect harsh feedback** — The skill defaults to critical. A 3/5 is average.
5. **Use slash commands** — They're faster than explaining what you want

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this work for non-tech roles?**
A: The core coaching works for any role. The role-specific drills currently cover PM, Engineering, Design, Data Science, Research, Operations, and Marketing.

**Q: Can I use this with ChatGPT or Gemini?**
A: The skill is designed for Claude, but you can adapt the prompts. Copy relevant sections from SKILL.md into your preferred AI.

**Q: Why is the feedback so harsh?**
A: Because sycophantic praise doesn't help you improve. The candidates who landed jobs in our research explicitly asked AI to be adversarial.

**Q: Is it ethical to use AI for interview prep?**
A: Using AI to prepare is no different than using books, coaches, or mock interviews. The skill helps you articulate your real experiences better—it doesn't fabricate credentials.
