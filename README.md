# Interview Coach v5

A high-rigor Claude skill for interview coaching — not just prep. It adapts to what you actually need based on your patterns, not a one-size-fits-all assembly line.

This skill is command-driven with conditional logic: after scoring, it branches coaching based on what the data reveals about your specific bottlenecks.

---

## What You Get

- **Adaptive coaching** that triages your bottlenecks and branches accordingly — not the same assembly line for every candidate
- **Five-dimension scoring**: Substance, Structure, Relevance, Credibility, and Differentiation — calibrated to your seniority level
- **Evidence-enforced feedback**: every claim tagged to source, with automatic pause when evidence runs thin
- **Root cause diagnosis**: scores map to underlying patterns (status anxiety, narrative hoarding, conflict avoidance, etc.) with targeted fixes
- **Storybank with rapid-retrieval drills**: stories you can actually access under pressure, not just a well-organized filing cabinet
- **Full mock interviews**: 4-6 question simulated interviews with holistic arc feedback, not just individual answer scoring
- **Psychological readiness**: pre-interview routines, mid-interview recovery, and post-interview processing
- **Post-offer negotiation coaching**: scripts, strategy, and specific language for compensation conversations
- **Differentiation as a first-class dimension**: earned secrets and spiky POVs integrated into every workflow, not an optional add-on
- **Self-assessment calibration**: tracks the gap between how you think you're doing and how you're actually doing
- **Outcome tracking**: correlates practice scores with real interview results to verify the coaching is working
- **Session continuity**: persistent `coaching_state.md` file maintains your storybank, scores, patterns, and progress across sessions — works over weeks or months of prep
- **Answer rewrites**: side-by-side before/after showing exactly what a 4-5 version of your answer looks like
- **Interview loop awareness**: tracks which stories you've used at each company so later rounds build on earlier ones
- **Cultural and linguistic awareness**: recognizes communication style differences and coaches adaptation, not replacement

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Claude Code — Terminal or IDE (recommended)

**Get the files** — either way works:

```bash
# Clone with git
git clone https://github.com/noamseg/interview-coach-skill.git
cd interview-coach-skill
```

Or: click the green **Code** button on GitHub → **Download ZIP**, unzip it, and open the folder.

**Activate the skill:**

```bash
cp SKILL.md CLAUDE.md
```

This creates the file that Claude Code auto-loads. (`SKILL.md` is the source — `CLAUDE.md` is your working copy.)

**Start coaching:**

Open the folder in Claude Code (terminal, Claude App, or Cursor) and run `/kickoff`.

The skill reads its reference files on demand and writes a `coaching_state.md` file to maintain continuity across sessions — no manual saving required.

**Works with**: Claude Code (terminal), Claude Code (Claude App), Cursor, or any environment with file system access.

### Option 2: Paste into conversation (limited)

1. Copy the contents of `SKILL.md` and paste at the start of a Claude conversation.
2. Run `/kickoff`.

Note: Without file system access, the skill cannot read reference files or write persistent state. It will still work for single-session use but with reduced depth.

## Fast Workflow Examples

### 1) Initial setup

```text
/kickoff
```

Expected output:

- Track selected (`Quick Prep` or `Full System`)
- Profile snapshot (strength signals and concern areas)
- Time-aware action plan (adjusted to your interview timeline)
- Initial COACHING_STATE document (save this!)

### 2) Before an interview

```text
/prep Stripe
```

Then provide:

- Job description
- Role/seniority
- Optional interviewer names or profile links

Expected output:

- `What They Optimize For`
- `Your Best Positioning`
- `Likely Concerns + Counters`
- `Predicted Questions (7-10)`
- `Story Mapping`
- `Questions To Ask Them`

### 3) After an interview

```text
/analyze
```

Then paste transcript text.

Expected output:

- Per-answer score blocks
- `Scorecard`
- `What Is Working`
- `Top 3 Gaps To Close`
- `Storybank Changes`
- `Priority Move (Next 72 Hours)`

### 4) Drill practice

```text
/practice
```

Drills (in progression order — advance when you meet gating thresholds):

- `/practice ladder` — Constraint drills (30s, 60s, 90s, 3min)
- `/practice pushback` — Handle skepticism and interruption
- `/practice pivot` — Redirect when questions don't match prep
- `/practice gap` — Handle "I don't have an example" moments
- `/practice role` — Role-specific specialist scrutiny
- `/practice panel` — Multiple interviewer personas
- `/practice stress` — High-pressure simulation
- `/practice retrieval` — Rapid-fire story matching

Expected output each round:

- `Round Debrief`
- `What Worked`
- `Gaps`
- `Scorecard` (5 dimensions)
- `Self-Assessment Delta`
- `Next Round Adjustment`

### 5) Full mock interview

```text
/mock behavioral Stripe
```

Runs a complete 4-6 question interview simulation with holistic feedback on:

- Overall impression and hiring signal
- Energy trajectory and pacing across the full arc
- Story diversity and selection quality
- Signal-reading (did you adapt to interviewer cues?)
- Per-question scoring + holistic patterns only visible across the full session

### 6) Post-offer negotiation

```text
/negotiate
```

Then provide offer details, competing offers, and ideal outcome. Get:

- Market position analysis
- Negotiation strategy with priority ordering
- Exact scripts for the conversation
- Fallback language for pushback

## Tracks

### Quick Prep

Best when interview timeline is short.

- Prep brief
- Focused transcript analysis
- Immediate next actions

### Full System

Best when running a multi-week search.

- Storybank management with rapid-retrieval drills
- Multi-lens transcript analysis with decision tree triage
- Pattern and trend tracking with self-assessment calibration
- Differentiation coaching integrated into all workflows
- Full mock interview simulations
- Outcome tracking (correlate practice with real results)
- Post-offer negotiation coaching
- Drill progression with gating thresholds

Choose during `/kickoff`. You can switch later.

## Best Results

1. Share a real resume (not a high-level summary).
2. Include a full job description for `/prep` — and the interview format if you know it.
3. Use real transcripts for `/analyze`. The more you give it, the better the triage.
4. Keep a living storybank with `/stories`. Extract earned secrets for every story.
5. Run `/progress` weekly — it tracks your self-assessment accuracy, not just scores.
6. After real interviews, log outcomes. The system correlates practice scores with real results.
7. Run `/mock` before important interviews. Individual drills build skills; mocks test the full arc.

## FAQ

**Does this only work for tech roles?**
No. Core workflows are role-agnostic; role drills include PM, Engineering, Design, Data Science, Research, Operations, and Marketing.

**Can I use this outside Claude?**
Yes, but it is authored for Claude skill behavior. If using another model, copy `SKILL.md` and adapt as needed.

**Why is the feedback direct?**
The skill is intentionally high-candor and evidence-based. It still uses strengths-first delivery and self-reflection before critique. It also periodically checks whether the coaching is landing and adapts if not.

**How does it work across multiple sessions?**
The skill writes a `coaching_state.md` file that tracks your storybank, scores, patterns, drill progression, interview outcomes, and more. At the start of each session, it reads this file and picks up where you left off. Automatic in any environment with file system access (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

**What's different about v5?**
v5 is a ground-up rethink. Session continuity via COACHING_STATE, adaptive triage with priority-stacked decision trees, 5-dimension scoring (with Differentiation), root cause diagnosis, worked examples as calibration anchors, answer rewrites showing concrete deltas, full mock interviews with named interviewer personas, drill progression with gating, post-offer negotiation, self-assessment calibration, outcome tracking, time-aware coaching, interview loop awareness, psychological readiness, signal-reading, gap-handling, cultural/linguistic awareness, and anti-pattern detection. The core shift: from "structured output" to "adaptive coaching that works over months."
